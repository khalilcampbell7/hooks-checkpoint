React Hooks Checkpoint
API & Resources

The API you'll be using for this project can currently be found at http://3.21.164.220/. Take a moment to review the API's data services and documentation to decide what calls you might want to make and how to format them:

The different data services for this api are
Products
Reviews
Questions & Answers
Cart
Interactions
Mandatory Requirements

Make an API call to get a product list (Products data service, subsection "list")
Make an API call to get specific details on a given product when its entry is clicked (Products data service - subsection ":productId")
Display a list of products as cards with text of description
Make each product clickable so that when clicked, it displays an image from the API for that product (Products data service - subsection "styles")
Make it so that only one product's photo is visible at a time, and clicking it again closes the photo (NOTE: If a product does not have a viable photo on the API, allow for this eventuality with good conditional rendering).
Advanced Content

Add a nav bar and button that will also close the photo and/or display the product list again.
Add miniature thumbnail photo to each product card
Add Review score to each product card (Reviews data service)
Add a display for Question/Answers to each product that is visible only when the photo is enlarged (Questions data service)
